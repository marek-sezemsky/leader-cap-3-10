# Leader cap increase for 3.10

Stellaris mod to increase base leader capacity to 100.

Based on "Leader cap increased" mod https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2973888089 

* adjusted for 3.10.x - uses snapshot of a base file -- All rights reserved (C) Stellaris Paradox Interactive.
* base capacity 100

## 3.10 changes

Unlike for pre-3.10, there's no longer overridable variable (?) in common/defines; I've tired to  fiddle with that and override again just the base, but could not get it working.
So patched copy it is. Original file - All rights reserved (C) Stellaris Paradox etc.

Tehnically this is stealing, but standalone mod is useless and players do have the original data anyways.

If the file changes upstream with subsequent Stellaris releases, the mod will override with own old version unless it's updated.

Why leaader capacity is there and why is not a game-start parameter, I don't know.
